This project includes a series of theoretical and practical tasks for machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). The tasks range from understanding Artificial Neural Networks to implementing algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms and Support Vector Machines, as well as utilizing text processing techniques like TF-IDF and topic modeling.

Machine Learning
1.1 Theoretical Tasks
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):
Present the architecture, main components, and application domains of ANN.
Discuss general types of ANN based on topology and domain of application.


Activation Functions:
Describe popular activation functions and their purposes.


Regression Trees:
Explain the concept of regression trees and their use in predictive modeling.
Discuss various methods of pruning trees to avoid overfitting.


1.2 Practical Task: Learning as a Search
The goal of this task is to minimize a given fitness function using different optimization methods and compare the results.

1.2.1 Fitness Function Definition

1.2.2 Tasks
Build a Plot:
Visualize the fitness function using Octave, Matlab, or Python and analyze its global and local minima.

Implement Genetic Algorithm (GA):

Implement a simple GA to minimize the fitness function using:
Population sizes of 10 and 100
Crossover operations: 25%, 50%, and 75%
Mutation percentages: 1%, 5%, and 50%
100 or 1000 iterations


Implement Gradient Descent:

Implement the Gradient Descent method to minimize the fitness function. Use learning steps of 1e-6, 0.1, and 1 over 1000 iterations.
Comparison of Methods: Compare the results of Genetic Algorithm and Gradient Descent in terms of convergence, speed, and whether they find the global or local minima.


1.3 Practical Task: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Train an SVM:
Find an SVM implementation with adjustable parameters, train it on a dataset using different values for C (0.1, 1.0, 100), and compare the results.

Evaluate Results:
Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the SVM.
Analyze common failure cases and how hyperparameters affect the results.
Natural Language Processing


2.1 Practical Task: Text Processing, Feature Extraction, and TF-IDF Representation
Data Preparation:

Load a dataset of movie reviews, clean the data by removing special characters, stop words, and irrelevant symbols, and combine columns to create a description field.


Text Preprocessing: Normalize words to lowercase, tokenize the text, and remove stop words.


TF-IDF Representation:Generate TF-IDF vectors for the movie descriptions and prepare them for further analysis.

2.2 Practical Task: Topic Modelling
Topic Modeling:
Use the preprocessed text data to generate topic models using two different algorithms from the following options: LDA, Truncated SVD, or Word2Vec.


Compare Results:
Compare the results and analyze the topics generated by each model.


2.3 Analysis Task: Search for Similar Movies
